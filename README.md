<p>Group project Ironhack Niharika &amp; Lukas</p>


<h2> Intro to the topic </h2>
<p>Since the 80's on every third weekend September the <u>dam tot dam loop</u>, a ten-mile run from Amsterdam to Zaandam takes place. 
The run is the biggest running event in the Netherlands and attracts between 40-50k people ranging from competitive and recreationists runners. 

In this analysis we are going to see whether there are noticeable differences between two categories:

<b>Business runner category <b> 
Includes runners who participate in the event together with co-workers. 

<b>Recreationists runner<b>
Includes runners who participate in the event individually. 

</p>


<h2> Research questions </h2>
